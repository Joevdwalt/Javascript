## Introduction

## Installation and pre-requisites

### Mac OSX 
This book will make extensive used of node js. The easiest way to install node js and manage it in the future is to uses Homebrew

*[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)*

Once you have home brew installed you can install node js by running the following command, in the terminal app.
``` bash
brew install node
```

You will also need a good text editor, although I prefer a modal text editor like vim, something like visual studio code, atom or sublime text would suffice. 

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Your first program and hello world
One you have node js installed you can run your first program by simply typing the following into a terminal session

``` bash
node 
```

This will open the REPL editor for node js and allows yout to run arbitrary commands. Try running the following in the REPL environment 

``` node  
console.log('hello world');
```
