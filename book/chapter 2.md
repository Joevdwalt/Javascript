## Your first program. 
We are going to create a new file call helloworld.js. After we have created the file we are going to add our programming code and then execute node to execute. 

1. Open a new terminal session. The session will drop into your home directory or the shortcut ~. 
2. Create a new directory for our program with the following command. It should look something similiar to 
```
$ mkdir helloworld
```

Then navigate to the directory 
``` 
$ cd helloworld
```

3. Create our javascript file 

```
$ touch helloworld.js 
```
4. To start editing you can open the file with the finder or with visual studio code. 

With finder 
``` 
open . 
```

with visual studio code 
```
code helloworld.js
```

5. Edit the text file 
in the text file add the following javascript code to the text file helloworl.js

``` javascript
console.log('hello world');
```
6. Run the code 
to run the program you can execute the following bash command using the terminal

``` bash 
node helloworld.js
```

if everthing went according to plan the system should pring 'hello world' to the command line. 

Well done you have built your first program. I know it seem like a very complicated procedure, but as you get used to the it, it will become quick and easy.
